# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
Of course you are welcome to contribute.

## Issues or Suggestions
If you find any issue either in the code or while using the cli or server you can always [create an issue.](https://github.com/yeboahnanaosei/ghanamps/issues)  
Hopefully, I will get the time to sort it out.  

Also if you have any suggestions why not, they are always welcome.

## PRs or Code contribution
For sure pull requests are always welcomed.  
The only tiny little thing I ask is that you try to write your commit messages by following what is in this article: [https://cbea.ms/git-commit/](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)

Do note that this is not a hard requirement. It is just a way to keep things uniform.
